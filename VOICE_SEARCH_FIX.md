# ✅ Voice Search Redirect Fix - Complete!

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
Voice search was redirecting users to a separate `/search` page that showed a reseller comparison interface instead of staying on the marketplace page with real Indian product data.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Removed SearchPage Redirect**
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- **Change**: Redirected `/search` route to `/marketplace` using `<Navigate to="/marketplace" replace />`
- **Result**: All voice search now stays on marketplace page

### 2. **Updated Navigation Calls**
- **HomePage**: `navigate('/search')` → `navigate('/marketplace')`
- **Header**: `navigate('/search')` → `navigate('/marketplace')`
- **HistoryPage**: `navigate('/search')` → `navigate('/marketplace')`

### 3. **Removed Unused SearchPage**
- **File**: `src/pages/SearchPage.tsx` - **DELETED**
- **Reason**: No longer needed since all voice search happens on marketplace
